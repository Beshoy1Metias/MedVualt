🚨 Project Idea: Smart MedVault – A Secure Medicine Reminder & Tracker App
💡 What It Is:

A command-line or web-based Python app that helps users securely track their medicine intake, set reminders, and access info about their meds. Bonus: Implement encryption for sensitive data (like user profiles and medicine schedules).
🔧 Why It’s Perfect for You:
Skill	How This Project Helps
🐍 Python	Build your fluency with real-world use
🔐 Cybersecurity	Practice hashing/encryption (e.g., AES, bcrypt)
📱 Embedded-systems thinking	Plan how this logic could be ported to hardware (e.g., Raspberry Pi pill dispenser later)
🧪 Pharmacy knowledge	You already understand medication use, schedules, side effects
🧠 CS Logic	Use classes, dictionaries, file I/O, scheduling, and maybe even SQLite
🚀 Startup-ready	This could eventually become a real mobile/web app for patients
🔨 Project Features

Here’s a realistic v1 scope:

Create and manage user profiles (with password hashing)

Add medicines: name, dose, frequency, side effects

Set reminders using scheduling libraries (like schedule or APScheduler)

Export history (CSV or PDF)

    Optional: basic GUI using Tkinter or web frontend with Flask

And if you want to level it up:

    🔒 AES encryption for storing user data

    🔔 Push notifications or email reminders

    📡 API to fetch Egyptian drug data (e.g., from a database you build manually)

🧩 What You'll Learn:

    Core Python (OOP, modules, error handling)

    Scheduling and automation

    File encryption and hashing

    Flask or Tkinter basics

    SQLite or simple NoSQL DBs

    CLI or GUI UX design thinking

    Practical use of your medical background in a CS project
